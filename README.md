# Kruskals-Algorithm
Kruskal's algorithm is a minimum-spanning-tree algorithm which finds an edge of the least possible weight that connects any two trees in the forest.
It is a greedy algorithm in graph theory as it finds a minimum spanning tree.

For the algorithm to work, you will need an text file that includes a string, followed by another string, followed by an int. The
strings are simply the names of nodes and the int is the cost of traveling between them.
